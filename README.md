# PSD-Conversion-Assignment-1

## Objective:

As per **[Juno College](https://junocollege.com)** guidelines:

Try to replicate a desing accurately and consistently as possible making use of the following:
- Using fluid design
- Media Queries
- Dynamic measurements
- Wrappers 
- CSS Setup snippet
- Images with alt text
- Consistent naming convention thoroughout

In this first assignment, I tried to push myself to use as less backgorund images as posible to include image descriptions for accessibility and making use of relatively new CSS properties (like object-fit)

In my opinion, this design relays heavily on the graphic material included, and its descriptive articles are closely related to the images presented.
